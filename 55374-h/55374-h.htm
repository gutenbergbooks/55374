</div>

<p class='c012'>Toward the close of a cool, pleasant day in September,
18—, the residents of the village of Readestown were startled
by seeing a horseman come dashing furiously into the
town.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was a middle-aged man, with dark, swarthy features,
piercing black eyes, a black mustache and dark hair. His
slender figure was clad in the costume of a native Mexican,
and he rode like an expert.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man bestrode a fine, swift bay mare, and as he went
thundering through the main street enveloped in a cloud of
dust at the top of the mare’s speed, he attracted considerable
attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>The horse finally paused before a palatial mansion, out
of the gate of which a beautiful young woman was coming,
and the Mexican politely raised his sombrero and asked in
good English:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Senora, can you direct me to the home of Frank Reade,
Jr.?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“This house is his residence,” replied the lady, curiously
eyeing the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! Thank you! Do you know if he is in?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He has gone away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gone!” gasped the man in startled tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Half an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Positive. I should know, as I am his wife.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But he will return soon?” eagerly asked the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; perhaps not for several weeks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dios mio! How unfortunate for me! The train I
came on from Boston broke down a league from here, and
in my haste to reach this place in season to catch him ere
he departed, I hired this horse and came in the saddle.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a pity you arrived too late!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, indeed; for it is with me a matter of life or death.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am astonished.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>“He has, of course, gone in his new flying machine?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly so, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When I landed from Mexico I read in the daily paper
that he had finished his marvelous invention, and intended
to make a trial trip in it this evening.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was your business important, sir?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very. So much so that I came all the way here from
Mexico to see him in relation to his new air-ship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am very sorry you failed to get here in time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have no idea of my own anxiety, senora.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps I might direct you so you could find him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do so, and I shall be very grateful indeed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, the machine ran against the wind, which blows
from the southwest, and made a successful ascension. The
last I saw of it it was heading due southwest of here. Just
five miles away in that direction lies the town of Foxhall,
at which Frank intends to pause awhile to examine the air-ship
and see how it stood the initial test. By going there
with all speed, you might reach him before he sends the
air-ship aloft again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you a thousand times. I shall try the plan.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And doffing his hat to her again, he started his mare off
in the indicated direction at a furious gallop.</p>

<p class='c000'>Off sped the gallant beast, watched by the wife of the inventor
of the flying machine, and he soon reached the open
prairie and urged his steed along at a breakneck pace.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Frank Reade, Jr., in question was a famous inventor
of steam, electrical and mechanical inventions of various
kinds.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had completed building the greatest air-ship he had
ever conceived of, and had added a crown to the glory of
his great talent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inventor was then a mere youth in years, and had as
companions on his pleasure trip two tried and trusted
friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>One was a rollicking Irishman, with a good-natured,
freckled face, a red head, and a devil-may-care disposition,
named Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other was a short darky, with long arms and a comical
face, who answered to the name of Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mexican knew all about the three, as the newspapers
of the period frequently referred to them in relation to the
journeys they had made together in former inventions which
Frank had conceived.</p>

<p class='c000'>He rode along at a pace that was bound to kill his horse
if he maintained it too long, and kept his burning, eager
glance fixed upon the sky in expectation of seeing the
strange invention.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a long ride, and to the rider it seemed to occupy
ages.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall—I must see him!” he muttered, desperately, as
his mare sped over the broad expanse of prairie. “If
Frank Reade, Jr., will do as I ask he shall be rewarded with
a treasure which must surpass that of a king. Oh, my poor
little boy! He will certainly be sacrificed by the Terror of
the Coast if the inventor refuses to aid me in rescuing him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Tears welled up into his eyes at the thought of the peril
in which his little son was placed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in a sudden paroxysm of resolution he dashed them
away and muttered hoarsely:</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no, no! I must not weakly give way to tears. It
is a time for action—not repining. On, my good horse, on,
on, and do what you can to carry me to my destination in
time to make one effort to save my child’s life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Urging would not make the mare go faster, for she was
then doing her best, and fairly snorting from the violent exertion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within half an hour the town of Foxhall appeared in
view, and the Mexican’s heart leaped with joy as the twinkling
lights of the windows met his glance in the distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>This feeling was rudely dashed, however, when, upon a
nearer approach to the settlement, he saw a huge object rise
from the ground and soar up into the sky ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>It then sped away from the settlement, going in a southeasterly
direction, and the man gave a groan of anguish.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is the flying machine now!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor was he mistaken.</p>

<p class='c000'>The peculiar object was two enormous aluminum planes
on a framework of steel, held aloft by strong metal posts.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the forward part was a smaller plane, the deflections
and inflections of which changed the angle of movement of
the machine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two enormous propellers drove the air-ship ahead by
whirling at a tremendous speed, and the car was oblong forward,
with a long ram, wheels at each side for running over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the ground, and a flat stern, at which hung a rudder for
use in water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Forward on deck stood a huge electric motor for operating
the drive wheels, and before it a powerful searchlight was
fastened.</p>

<p class='c000'>The after deck was covered by a bullet-proof wire cage,
and the pilot occupied a small conning tower under the
forward deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was very evident that the principle of operating the
Jove, as the ship was named, was by imitating a boy’s kite.</p>

<p class='c000'>Simply by driving the planes against the wind caused the
air to lift the machine into the sky, and once elevated, by
keeping it constantly moving, suspension was sustained.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a man in the turret, and two men on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mexican could plainly distinguish their outlines,
and a mad, baffled feeling overwhelmed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Must I lose after all the exertion I put forth?” he
groaned, hoarsely. “No! By heavens, I’ll chase that machine
till my steed falls dead beneath me, and I’ll scream
till my voice leaves me to attract their attention.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He raced on wildly after the flying air-ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>He shouted, he waved his handkerchief, and he raved at
his horse to go faster.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a wild and fearful ride, and it seemed to the unfortunate
man as if the Jove was fast leaving him behind
as it glided through the dusky sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>On, on, on raced the pursuer and pursued over the open
country, and several miles were thus covered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally the mare tripped and fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man’s heart sank as he leaped from her back to
avoid being injured under her body.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Merciful Heavens! This ends it!” he groaned, in despair,
as he landed upon his feet upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>That fall killed the gallant mare.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the man paid no heed to her, for all his time and attention
were taken up staring at the Jove.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly he started, bent forward eagerly, and a thrill
of joy ran through him as he saw the great air-ship go in a
circle, drop lower into another strata of air, and approach
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They see me! They see me at last!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up to him swept the huge air navigator, until at last it
was hovering three hundred feet aloft, just above his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hello, there!” came a hail from above.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take me aboard!” screamed the Mexican.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Were you chasing us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes—for many miles.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a desperate case. I’ll explain——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come up here and explain yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank God!” fervently muttered the stranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>As this exclamation escaped his lips a long, light rope
ladder came flying down through the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>One end of it was fastened to the air-ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other end landed near the Mexican, and he rushed
forward, seized it, and began to climb up.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a risky climb, for the ladder swayed with every
movement he made while ascending.</p>

<p class='c000'>He grimly kept on, though.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments he reached the deck aft.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the two men seized him and helped him up.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same moment the air-ship turned and dashed up
higher into the atmosphere and resumed its journey south-westward.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extra weight of the Mexican seemed to make but
slight difference in the buoyancy of the machine.</p>

<p class='c000'>He now turned his attention upon the two occupants of
the cage, one of whom was Frank Reade, Jr.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='II' class='c009'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>A DANGEROUS FALL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>For a few moments a deep silence ensued between the
three, for they were sizing each other up keenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mexican observed that Frank was a fine-looking
young man, with an athletic figure, clad in a traveling costume.
His handsome face showed a good disposition and a
high order of courage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ramey was the person with him, and he held a violin,
upon which he had been playing a lively tune.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally the Mexican spoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are Frank Reade, Jr., I believe?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am,” admitted the inventor, “and you——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Juan Zamora, the alcalde, or head man of the town of
Santa Cruz, Mexico, on the Gulf coast.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>“I am pleased to know you, sir. What do you want of
me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A week ago I read an account of this extraordinary
air-ship, and I came at once to Readestown to try to hire the
machine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I regret to say I will not let it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, but I will pay you a princely sum for one month’s
use of the machine. I am a rich man and can afford to. Besides
the sum of fifty thousand dollars, I will put a pirate’s
treasure into your hands which is worth millions of dollars.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your offer is extraordinary, Mr. Zamora.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But it is actuated by a most potent cause.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So I imagined. But explain your reason.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall. On the coast of Mexico there is a pirates’ retreat.
It is ruled by an American outlaw called Captain
Diavolo. His gang numbers several hundred men—the
scum of all nations. He owns a fleet of swift ships that
prey upon passing vessels. In these attacks he is always
successful—all hands are killed, and the captured vessels
are plundered and scuttled. Many a ship that never came
back, but mysteriously disappeared, merely fell a victim to
the Terror of the Coast, as we call this fiend.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have never heard of him,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; for never has one of his victims escaped to tell of
his crimes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What has all this to do with you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am coming to that part presently. The Mexican Government
did everything possible to get rid of him, but all
its efforts proved to be of no avail. He successfully eluded
them all. Perhaps his most relentless enemy was myself.
I did all I could to break up his infernal crew, and aroused
his wrath. He swore to avenge himself upon me; to carry
out his vengeance, he one night invaded Santa Cruz with
every man he could muster, and shot every one on sight.
Having driven out the inhabitants, he plundered and set fire
to many of the dwellings. My little five-year-old son, Leon,
was carried away into captivity by the wretches, with myself,
and Captain Diavolo told me that he was going to torture
me to death. As for my child, they swore to educate
him to become one of the foulest ruffians on earth, so that
if he were finally captured, he would meet a violent doom.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Horrible!” muttered Frank, with a shudder.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Imagine my feelings,” said Zamora. “However, let it
suffice that after a week of captivity among the pirates, I
saw the great treasure they had amassed and learned all the
secrets of their retreat. Before the day of my execution I
escaped. After many hardships I returned to my native
town. It was while I was there that I learned of this flying
machine, and gained the idea that I might hire it to attack
my enemies and rescue my little child from their
clutches.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So that’s what you want the Jove for, eh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly. I am in momentary fear that Captain Diavolo
may take it into his head to kill poor little Leon, and therefore
am impatient to go to his rescue as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’t your Government aid you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not in the least. I have already attempted to get relief
from that source, but failed. Only by utilizing some such
contrivance as this can I hope to succeed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was intensely interested in the man’s story, and
when Zamora had told him how he had gone to Readestown
and then chased the machine, he began to ponder deeply.</p>

<p class='c000'>An idea flashed into his mind, and he said to Barney:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have faith in this unfortunate man’s story.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faix! I have that same,” replied the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I am going to help him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“More power ter yer for doin’ so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have no particular purpose in view. One has arisen.
Suppose we go to the Gulf Coast and wipe out this Terror?
Would you like to undertake it, Barney?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wud a dook swim?” grinned the Celt, for the prospect
of lots of fighting and excitement just suited his taste.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank then shouted to Pomp, who stood steering in the
conning tower:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you hear what was said, Pomp?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Deed I did, Marse Frank,” the coon replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you think of my plan?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sabe de pickaninny an’ wallop dem yere pirates, sah?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s my idea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwine fo’ ter git a fo’tune fo’ doin’ dat?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Senor Zamora says he will show us where the pirates’
treasure is if we break up the gang, so we can take it away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Close de bargain, honey; close de bargain!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well. Mr. Zamora, we will go with you to the pirates’
lair and break up the gang and rescue your child. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>this we do not want any of your money. We will take our
pay by levying on the pirates’ treasure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“God bless you for your kindness, Mr. Reade.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Say no more. We have the most dangerous kind of weapons
aboard, and need make no preparations. As you can
see, this machine is a perfect success. All we need do is to
proceed to the Mexican Gulf and begin operations as soon
as possible.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have no guarantee that my story is true.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, we trust you readily enough, for should your account
not be true, we have nothing to lose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thank you and bless you from the bottom of my
heart!” said the delighted man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can do that when I have accomplished something,”
said Frank, with a smile. “I shall, of course, expect you
to do your share of the work in managing this machine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Most decidedly,” assented the Mexican.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then come inside, and I’ll show you how she works, in
order to make you familiar with the machine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving Barney on watch in the cage on deck, the young
inventor went through the door, descended several steps,
and the Mexican followed and found himself in the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was prettily furnished, and served as a dining-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Forward of this room were two small apartments, one
containing some bunks, and the other served as a kitchen,
the range being heated by electricity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still further forward was a large pilot-house, in which
stood the darky managing the Jove’s steering wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>This wheel controlled the small plane forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>A compass binnacle was beside him, and on the other side
there was a table, on which were fastened several electric
controllers, levers and switches, cut-outs and plugs.</p>

<p class='c000'>By means of the latter the mechanism of the air-ship was
controlled by the pilot.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the stem of the Jove was a storeroom and a dynamo-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>The former compartment contained food, water, arms,
ammunition, armor, ropes, clothing, tools, and various other
things.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the engine-room was a huge generator, which was
worked by powerful springs, its current running to the deck
motor, to which the driving screws were geared.</p>

<p class='c000'>The current also illuminated numerous incandescent
lamps, and worked several fan motors in each of the rooms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank explained everything to the Mexican.</p>

<p class='c000'>He then told Zamora to turn in, as he would have to go
on watch at two in the morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>While he was speaking, Frank heard a distant yell in
Pomp’s voice, and hastened up forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stop dat, chile! Stop dat!” he heard Pomp howl
wildly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens!” chuckled Barney’s voice; “I’d be afther
takin’ a batin’ first. Biff, ye divil, take that now!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ouch! my eye!” yelled the coon. “Fo’ de Lor’ sakes,
yo’ want to kill me wif dat bean-shooter?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ha, ha, ha!” shouted the Irishman, gleefully. “It’s
dook-shot I’m peggin’ at ye now, but it’s nothin’ less nor
a cannon ball wud make a dent in that bullet-proof head
you are wearin’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Following this remark came a violent rattle of shot which
flew from his bean-shooter, some of which hit Pomp and
made him swear like a trooper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irishman was on deck, and was shooting the pellets
at the coon’s head through the open windows of the tower.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Pomp had to grin and take it, too, for he dared not
leave the wheel, for fear of some accident happening to the
Jove.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was hard to tell how much more he would have stood
of this bombardment had Frank not shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why don’t you shut the windows, you donkey?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lan’ sakes!” gasped Pomp, complying, “why didn’ I
fink ob dat befo’? Golly! what a fool niggah I is!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irishman and the coon were all the time playing
practical jokes on one another, and the moment Barney
heard Frank’s voice, he looked startled and bolted for the
cage.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he did not reach it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tripping over a chest, he fell to the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same moment a slant of wind caused the air-ship
to suddenly keel over, and Barney rolled over to the edge of
the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave a wild yell of horror as he felt his body going
over the oval side, and nothing in reach to check his fall.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed as if the Irishman was doomed, and a sickening
sensation passed over him as he fell from the airship.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The ground was at least one thousand feet below, and as
he went plunging down toward it, he realized that the moment
he should strike there he would instantly be killed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='III' class='c009'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>OVERTURNED IN THE AIR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>When Pomp closed the windows, he did not shut off the
view of Barney, but he paid no further heed to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>All his care and watchfulness were necessary to guide the
Jove properly, and he turned his glance ahead again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had heard the Irishman’s frightened yell, though,
and wondered what had caused it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never suspecting the tragic occurrence, he went up into
the cage and glanced around curiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>No reply was returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor did he see the Celt.</p>

<p class='c000'>He became alarmed at once over the man’s disappearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I say, Barney, where are you?” he continued.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still no answer was given.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank rushed up on deck and glared around.</p>

<p class='c000'>A moment later he heard a groan coming from somewhere
in the gloom, and then a husky voice crying:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fer ther love av Heaven, help me, Frank!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are you?” demanded the perplexed inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hangin to a wheel on ther starboard soide, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Bending over, Frank saw him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irishman was hanging below the flying machine,
clinging to the after wheel, which his hands had encountered
when he made that awful plunge earthward.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good heavens!” gasped Frank; “how did you get
there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, I fell from the deck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hold on and I’ll save you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Make haste, or it’s a dead man I am!”</p>

<p class='c000'>His strength was fast waning, and Frank realized it, but
the young inventor was puzzled how to act.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irishman was in an awkward position to be reached,
but Frank quickly hit upon a plan whereby he might save
his friend at a risk to himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rushing into the cage he got a small coil of rope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hastily carrying it out on deck, he made one end fast to a
cleat and dropped the other end down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seizing the rope, Frank slid down, and getting on a level
with Barney, he found that a distance of about ten feet separated
him from his friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurry!” groaned the Celt. “I can’t howld on much
longer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll have you in a moment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, yer can’t raich me from there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes, I shall.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How?” demanded Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll see. When I grab you, you let go your hold.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s me loife will be in your hands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I realize that, and will look out for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As Frank spoke he wound one arm and leg around the
rope to keep a firm hold, and then began to swing the line.</p>

<p class='c000'>Back and forth he swayed, each moment drawing closer
to his imperilled companion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally he swung in arm’s reach of Barney and grabbed
him by the arm, at the same moment shouting:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Having implicit confidence in the young inventor, the
Celt obeyed, and they swung back.</p>

<p class='c000'>There they swayed like a huge clock pendulum in mid
air, Frank holding the Irishman by the arm with one hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Back and forth they tossed for several moments, the violent
action of the line diminishing momentarily.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally it had almost paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you rested?” panted Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yis, a troifle.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I’m rapidly exhausting.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How are we ter git out av this?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’t you hang on to the rope a little?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can that. Give me a grip.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He managed to get hold of the line.</p>

<p class='c000'>The line was grating upon the edge of the deck above,
and straining and creaking dangerously under the combined
weight of the two.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a few seconds they clung to the line, and Frank cast
an anxious glance upward at it, and muttered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope it won’t break.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, we’ll both go down if it do!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Hey, Pomp!” shouted the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sah,” replied the coon, from the pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come out here—quick—we’re in danger!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lawd amassy! I dassent leabe de wheel!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fasten it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The coon obeyed reluctantly, for as soon as his hands left
the spokes, the soaring machine began to get unsteady.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would glide ahead smoothly awhile, then would suddenly
plunge to one side or the other, or move up or down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out came the darky.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as he saw the peril his comrades were in, though,
he forgot all about the Jove, and roared:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Kain’t yo’ git up, sah?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not very well without help,” Frank replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whut yo’ want me to do, honey?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Send down a noosed line.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp complied with the greatest alacrity.</p>

<p class='c000'>While Frank held Barney, the Irishman put the noose
around his body, and Pomp fastened the end of the line.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a remarkably short space of time the Celt was left
hanging there and Frank ascended to the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as he regained his breath, and recovered from his
exhaustion, he and Pomp hauled Barney up.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was some time afterward before they had entirely recovered
from the effects of their violent exertion, and discussed
all the details of the matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>As no one was injured, and Barney needed a good rest,
he finally turned in and fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank then relieved his sable friend of the wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will assume the first watch,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To be sho’,” assented Pomp. “Am yo’ satisfied wif her,
Massa Frank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; the machine is certainly the greatest invention I
have ever turned out. And she’s the simplest kind of an
air-ship to work. It is only necessary to elevate the angle
of the propeller plane, drive her faster, and ascend to any
height. To go down, the impinging edge of the forward
plane is simply depressed, and she descends. To remain at
a fixed altitude we have only to keep the rudder perfectly
horizontal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No gas bags to bust wif dis high flyer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And as long as our mechanism operates she’ll go ahead.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But s’posin’ de propellers done stop?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She would fall gently, as her planes would act on the
wind like parachutes,” replied Frank, promptly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat make her safer yet, don’ it, chile?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course,” Frank assented, with a nod.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ gwine straight to de Gulf of Mexico?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am. In two or three days we’ll reach it, too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat am if nuffin’ happen, sah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank nodded and smiled, and examined the electric motors
to see that the current did not vary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dynamo was working under full load of five hundred
volts, with an output of thirty kilowatts at the terminals,
and as the gloom of night had fallen, Frank turned one of
the switches.</p>

<p class='c000'>It sent the electric current into the searchlight, and a
brilliant flood of fifty thousand candle power light gushed
out.</p>

<p class='c000'>A funnel-shaped streak of white light was projected a
mile ahead by the powerful lens, and the barometer showed
the inventor that they had gone up to a height of nine hundred
and sixty rods, or three miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>People on the earth imagined the searchlight was a comet
with an extremely long tail, when the clouds did not conceal
its flight across the firmament.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the wind was dead ahead, and the strata they
were in blew at the velocity of fifty miles an hour, the Jove
was forging into it at the rate of forty miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank depressed the rudder, and the machine slowly
drifted downward, as she was then in an extremely cold region.</p>

<p class='c000'>At two o’clock Zamora and Barney relieved the inventor
and the coon, who thereupon turned in.</p>

<p class='c000'>The airship traveled stiffly, steadily and well for two days,
traversing the continent in a southerly direction and passing
the most diversified scenery.</p>

<p class='c000'>When night fell upon the scene again the sky had a dark,
ominous appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, Frank realized that as they were in the tropical
cyclone region he had cause to fear a heavy storm, and for
that reason he refused to retire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney remained up with him that night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward midnight the airship stood at an altitude of
5,280 feet in the air, when a jet-black cloud was encountered.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was rushing toward it, and the cloud ran at her.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>In a moment she was shot into the middle of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her entrance into the cloud seemed to agitate it.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first the motion was easy, but gradually it intensified,
and began to shake and toss the Jove.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then it began to whirl.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon this motion grew furious.</p>

<p class='c000'>The airship was checked in its flight, and spun around
with the gyrating cloud at an appalling speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A cyclone!” gasped Frank, in alarm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look out!” yelled Barney. “We’re upsettin’!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jove was suddenly hurled high up into the air like
a mere wisp of straw in the terrible blast.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was then dashed downward by a reacting gust, and as it
fell, it swung over upon its side and suddenly capsized.</p>

<p class='c000'>A scene of terrible confusion followed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='IV' class='c009'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>POMP’S ESCAPE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Most everything aboard the airship was stationary; but
there were, of course, many loose articles, and they were
sent flying in all directions when the machine capsized.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was holding the wheel, and thus saved himself
from being knocked about, but the Irishman was sent flying.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was slammed against the wall, then he was rolled over
and over until finally he laid on the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c000'>A second plunge of the machine bounced him across the
room, and he seized a post and clung to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp and Zamora fared equally as hard, and every one
of them suffered a tremendous thumping from the flying
articles that pelted them all over.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look out you don’t go through a window!” shouted
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens, it’s black an’ blue I am, entoirely!” Barney
groaned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are falling earthward now!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Howly St. Pathrick! Sthop her!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then we’re kilt!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Down plunged the machine swiftly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its movement sent a sickening sensation through them.</p>

<p class='c000'>A deafening thunder clap roared out close by, and at the
same instant there came a flash of blinding lightning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shock and glare were awful.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed to Frank that the airship had been struck by
the bolt.</p>

<p class='c000'>At any rate the wind got under the planes a moment after
she capsized, and the speed of her descent brought an awful
pressure to bear upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result was that the planes were forced up, and as the
car was heaviest, it rapidly went down.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment more the Jove had righted herself, and the
speed of her descent rapidly diminished.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of joy escaped her crew.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Safe!” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begob, I kin hardly belave me eyes!” replied Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>In rushed the darky and the Mexican excitedly, and the
latter asked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Has the machine broken?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no,” replied Frank. “We are quite safe now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Spec she done stood on her head,” said Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, she capsized, but righted herself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hadn’t yer betther start thim propellers?” Barney
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ain’t they revolving?” queried the inventor, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Divil a bit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Queer. I left the current on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ef de Jove was gwine ahead, honey,” said Pomp, “I
reckon she wouldn’t fall dis way, would she?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No. Something must have happened to the machinery.
I will examine it and find out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As the inventor spoke he set to work.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jove was descending in huge circles, and the two
great propellers hung perfectly motionless.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every few moments a violent gust of wind struck the machine,
and spun it around like a top or dashed her ahead,
up, down, or sidewise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lightning kept blazing, and claps of the heaviest
thunder rolled and crashed incessantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still they kept falling, and as the planes acted as parachutes
their descent was necessarily very gradual.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finding nothing wrong inside, Frank passed out on deck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>just as the machine dropped from the storm cloud into a
perfect deluge of rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the inventor was drenched in a minute, he paid
no heed to this inconvenience, but examined the motor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here he found the cause of the trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lightning had hit the field magnet, glanced off, and
tore the insulation from the wire winding.</p>

<p class='c000'>It thus was caused to leak, and as no magnetic influence
was imparted, the Jove’s propellers failed to operate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank could not repair the damage then.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ fine de trouble, Marse Frank?” cried Pomp, joining
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; the magnet was injured by the lightning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly! Kain’t yo’ fix it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not now. We’ll land in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whar am we, chile?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Blest if I know. Over Mexico somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat yere gulf kain’t be far off.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I quite agree with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The searchlight was now deflected by Barney, and it
showed Frank the ground below.</p>

<p class='c000'>A number of tall, slender cocoa palms were scattered here
and there, and among them grew numberless huge cactus
plants.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s danger of hitting a tree, Barney!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, it’s little I kin do wid ther ruddher,” the Celt
replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Try to keep her off them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, I have me oye on thim.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank watched the ship’s descent keenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was going at a gradual angle for the earth, and
soon arrived within fifty feet of the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she swept ahead, two huge palms loomed up directly
in her path.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney made a desperate effort to avoid them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look out!” he yelled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’t you turn her?” asked Frank, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not an inch.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then we’ll strike.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bedad, I——”</p>

<p class='c000'>Crash!</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney’s remark was interrupted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jove had gone in violent contact with the trees, and
the shock knocked Pomp down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was more fortunate, as he clung to the rail, and the
coon fell from the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Murder!” he howled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thunder!” gasped Frank, in alarm.</p>

<p class='c000'>He expected to find the darky a mangled corpse.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no time to see where Pomp landed, for the
Jove glided backward, and then darted ahead again.</p>

<p class='c000'>She missed the trees, and quickly struck the ground, with
several of her stays broken by the collision.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she landed at an angle upon her wheels she merely
received a gentle shock, and skated ahead over the ground
for a distance of several hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out rushed Barney and Zamora.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do she be hurted?” asked the Celt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not as badly as I expected,” Frank answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I feared the worst, senor,” said the Mexican.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, she is strongly built.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where’s the naygur?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The shock knocked him from the deck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bad cess to ther spalpeen, why did he fall at all?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Couldn’t help himself, I presume.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s ther undhertaker he’ll be needin’ now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I fear he’s badly hurt. Come and see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They alighted and ran back, looking for the coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was so dark, however, that they could not see except
when the lightning flashed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although they keenly looked about whenever they had the
chance, and reached the palms they had struck, they saw
nothing of Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, he must have garn clane troo ther ground,” said
Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s queer where he could have disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hey, naygur!” yelled Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he ceased speaking a green cocoanut flew through the
air, banged against his head, almost knocking him down,
and the nut burst and drenched him with the milk it contained.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Worra! Worra!” yelled Barney. “It’s a mane thrick
fer ther loikes av you to play on me, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“I didn’t play any trick on you, Barney,” replied the inventor,
in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“D’yer mane ter say yer didn’t soak me wid a cobble
sthone?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I most certainly did not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Feel av me head; it’s broken intoirely, an’——”</p>

<p class='c000'>Biff! came another nut just then.</p>

<p class='c000'>It caught Barney in the breadbasket, made him grunt,
and he doubled up and fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he did so the lightning flashed, and he saw the grinning
face of Pomp in the top of the tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s that ebony gorilla!” he howled, and he sprang to
his feet, spit on his hands, danced up and down, and waving
his fists, he yelled:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come down out av that, ye pug-nosed bandit, till I take
a lung out av yer!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ain’t gwine ter come down till yer g’way,” replied
Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens, I’ll chop down ther tree, then!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shut up, Barney,” cried Frank. “I say, Pomp.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yassah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did you get up there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Done falled here off de boat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see. That tree top must have been under her at the
time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Spec so, honey.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come down. Are you hurt any?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lordy, no. Amn’t eben scratched. Take away dat I’ish
setter, an I come down dar.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank sent Barney away, and the coon reached the earth
glad enough over his providential escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was so glad to see his friend safe that he did not
molest him when they returned to the Jove.</p>

<p class='c000'>Despite the storm, the four got at the broken and damaged
parts of the airship and repaired them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they set a watch for the night, and turned in with
the intention of departing at daybreak.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='V' class='c009'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>THE TERROR OF THE COAST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Great heavens! What is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank gave utterance to this startled exclamation just
as the light of the rising sun streamed into the room where
he had been peacefully sleeping.</p>

<p class='c000'>A violent shake had aroused him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Glancing up he observed half a dozen strange men in the
cabin, and a keen scrutiny showed him that they were a
gang of ruffians of the vilest stamp.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were of different nationalities, were clad in rough
garments, their faces were darkened by the sun, and every
one of them carried weapons in their belts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank sat bolt upright.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he did so, the biggest man in the party pulled a huge
navy revolver from his belt, pointed it squarely at the inventor’s
head, and cried in the Mexican language:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stop, or I’ll fire!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was a good linguist and understood him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The action confirmed his suspicions of these individuals
who had entered while all were sleeping.</p>

<p class='c000'>In nowise frightened by the Mexican’s action or remark,
the young inventor coolly replied in Spanish:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“First, I want to know what this contrivance is?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A flying machine,” answered Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>An incredulous roar of laughter greeted this explanation,
all the strangers joining in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally the big man subdued his mirth, and chuckled:</p>

<p class='c000'>“A flying machine, eh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly,” was Frank’s emphatic reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you mean to say it can fly?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; of course; how else could we get it here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll make you prove your assertion presently.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I can easily do that,” said Frank. “What next?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you any valuables aboard here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That depends upon what you consider valuable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Money or jewelry.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have a few hundred dollars,” admitted Frank, quickly,
as he observed his companions now awake.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, you have, eh? Where are they?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why do you wish to know?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What an innocent you are, to be sure. Why, I want
them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are thieves, then?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never mind our characters. Shell out!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“May I ask your names first?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“I don’t mind telling you. Very likely you have heard of
me before, as I’m well known. I am Captain Diavolo!”</p>

<p class='c000'>If he expected to create a sensation with this announcement
he was not mistaken.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank did not expect to meet the person he was in quest
of so soon, or under these circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>He did not betray any agitation, however.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So,” he remarked, “you are the Terror of the Coast,
eh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; and now you know enough not to trifle with me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you not the man who abducted little Leon Zamora?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course I am; and I’ve got the young whelp yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I presume the child is safe and well?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I’m sorry to say he is!” growled the pirate, with a
dark scowl. “I owe his accursed father a debt of vengeance,
and I’ll take satisfaction out of the brat!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank glanced at Zamora.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had drawn Captain Diavolo out in order to let the
anxious father hear that his son was safe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The information must have filled Zamora with intense
relief, and Frank quietly asked the pirate:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is the little boy?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s none of your confounded business,” roared the
pirate. “I did not come here to hold a confidential talk with
you; we merely want your valuables.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you then depart?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps—with this machine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll see if it works. If it should prove useful I’ll take it
to use for my own purposes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, I see. Where did you come from?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The coast, of course.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it near here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Less than a league.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now tell me——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shut up, I tell you! Give me your money!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll have to get up to do that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well; rise. But if you offer to play any tricks on
me I’ll let daylight through your head!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank nodded and smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leisurely rising, he put on his clothes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men with Captain Diavolo could not help admiring
his coolness and courage in the face of the present danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as Frank was ready he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come this way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You fellows remain here,” exclaimed the captain in
English to his men. “If any of those men in the berths attempt
to get up, fire at them. Do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ay, ay!” replied the sailors.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had gone ahead into the pilot-house, and rapidly
unfastening an electric wire from a binding-post, he hooked
it upon the brass handle of a drawer in the wainscoting.</p>

<p class='c000'>This drawer was locked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as he finished the captain stalked in.</p>

<p class='c000'>He still clutched his pistol in his hand, and glaring at
Frank, he growled in curious tones:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why have you brought me in here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To give you our valuables.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, where are they?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In that drawer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take them out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Get them yourself if you want them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Remember my threat! If you move, I’ll fire.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I can’t get away. I’m cornered.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A sardonic grin overspread the dark, bearded face of the
rascal, and laying his pistol on the floor within easy reach as
he knelt before the drawer, he seized the handle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he gave a pull.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the drawer refused to open.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s locked!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no,” replied Frank. “It sticks. Use both hands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The thief complied and gave a long, strong pull.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same moment Frank turned a switch, which sent
a powerful electric current into the metal handle of the
drawer, through the wire he had hooked on there.</p>

<p class='c000'>The muscles of Captain Diavolo tightened spasmodically
upon the handles so that he could not release them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Santa Maria!” he screamed, in hoarse tones of surprise,
as he glared at his hands and wondered why he could not
relax his grip. “I’m full of needles!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You don’t say!” laughed Frank, picking up his revolver
and cocking it. “How strange!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By the fiend! I can’t let go!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“So much the worse for you. That fact places you at my
mercy!” said Frank, grimly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, don’t shoot me. I haven’t done you any harm.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will fire if you don’t stop struggling.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As Frank said this, he started the big propellers.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a loud, whirring sound they whirled around, and
drove the airship ahead over the ground on her wheels.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men in the back room became alarmed, and one of
them rushed out the back door to see why the Jove was
speeding along over the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>The machine gathered headway rapidly, and soon was
speeding at the rate of forty miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind got under her planes and up in the air she rose
like a mighty bird, and shot ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the men now became terrified.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rushing aft they reached the deck, and as the Jove was
ascending, they sprang to the ground one after another, and
rolled over and over.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Diavolo was left to his fate, yelling like a demon
to be relieved of the awful electric current, for he did not
know what it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>Higher and higher mounted the airship upon the wind,
and all Frank’s companions hastily got up, dressed and saw
what had happened to the invaders.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they rushed into the pilot-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as they entered Captain Diavolo gave a strong pull
at the handle of the drawer, and tore it off.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the electric wire became detached the current ceased,
and the burly rascal dropped the handle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turning round, he came face to face with Zamora!</p>

<p class='c000'>For an instant they stood glaring fiercely at each other,
the outlaw too surprised to utter a single word.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What have you done with my child?” cried the Mexican.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You—here?” gasped the captain, chokingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Answer my question, you beast, or I’ll strangle you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll never know!” hissed the pirate, vindictively.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll tear the secret from you!” shouted Zamora, excitedly,
and he sprang at his enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>They grappled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Zamora had the pirate by the throat.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a few moments a fierce struggle went on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they fell heavily to the floor, where the fight was resumed
with the most bitter animosity.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VI' class='c009'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>SHOT BY A LAND BATTERY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In the midst of Zamora’s excitement, he evidently designed
to kill Captain Diavolo, for he had his hand on the
pirate’s windpipe and choked him until he was blue in the
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell me where Leon is,” the Mexican kept panting, furiously.
“Tell me what you have done with my child!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let go!” hoarsely gasped the pirate. “I’ll tell nothing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Separate them, boys,” said Frank to his friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp carried out this order with great difficulty,
as the two fighters resented their interference.</p>

<p class='c000'>They finally dragged Zamora away, however, and Barney
exclaimed, in wrathy tones:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Kape sthill, ye dago! D’yer want to chate ther hangman
out av a beautiful job?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me get at him!” panted Zamora, furiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whoa!” roared Pomp. “Mild up dar, Bolivar! Don’
want no funerals heah. Sit down dar, or we’ll make yo’!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And they pinned him into a chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank in the meantime had cut the current out of the
live wire for fear of its setting fire to the carpet, and then
he leveled the big pistol at the captain, and said, sternly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hands up, sir!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I obey,” said Diavolo, complying quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Drop down on your knees.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir; but do not fire.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And down he went on his marrow bones, with his hands
raised above his head, and the early morning sunlight
streaming through the pilot-room windows upon his pale,
haggard face.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jove was still mounting higher in the air, and the
five men who had been with the captain and jumped overboard
had now vanished from view in a dense thicket.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three miles away to the southward lay the sparkling waters
of the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney, bind this man,” said Frank, “and then we may
learn where he has his ships and stronghold, and the little
boy prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“What do you intend to do with me?” asked the prisoner,
uneasily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will see when the proper time comes,” Frank replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney quickly had him secured.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a sullen look upon his face as he sat on the
floor glaring up at his captors, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you imagine you can induce me to tell you any of my
secrets, you will find yourself wofully mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the contrary,” replied Frank, with a smile of confidence,
“you will impart to me all the information I desire.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Death itself has no terrors for me——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But living torture may.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Diavolo turned pale.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was just what he feared.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank observed his evident alarm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see I’ve touched your weak point,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain made no reply, but a sullen look settled upon
his hang-dog face, and he gnashed his teeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shall I bate ther head av him?” asked Barney, cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” replied Frank; “but you can fasten the end of that
copper wire around his neck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A veritable howl escaped the pirate when Barney carried
out Frank’s instructions, for he had had a sample of the
wire, and knew what to expect.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For pity’s sake, don’t let me suffer that again,” he
begged.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As long as you answer my questions,” said Frank, “I
will do you no harm; refuse, and you will get a shock fully
ten times stronger than the first one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Speak! What shall I tell you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“First, where are we to find Leon Zamora?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“At my retreat,” was the reluctant reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In what part of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My castle cellar.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How many men have you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“One hundred and fifty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ships, and what kind?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Two schooners and a steamer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All manned and armed?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. Each has a crew of thirty or forty men, and carries
guns.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are these vessels?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Two are cruising and one is at my stronghold.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell me where your retreat is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A few miles from Santa Anna.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Many men there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Over fifty, and the wives of all hands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank questioned him further, and learned a great many
points about the pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>He realized several times that the captain lied and evaded
his questions, but, upon the whole, he had learned nearly all
he wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c000'>In conclusion he asked the captain:</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did you and your men happen to find this machine?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We were passing here by chance on our way to our settlement,
when we caught view of her, and came aboard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see,” muttered Frank, nodding.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are my men—prisoners?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; they jumped overboard and escaped.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m glad of that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No doubt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank then ordered his two chums to lock the man up in
one of the rooms, and as they led him from the pilot-house,
the Mexican said to the young inventor:</p>

<p class='c000'>“With that scoundrel as a hostage, we will be sure to recover
my child in exchange for him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just what I figured on,” responded Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can pilot you to his stronghold now if you like.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Post me on the course, by all means,” replied Frank,
eagerly; “for I wish to go there to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They finally turned in and passed a peaceful night, and
on the following day Zamora posted himself at the window
and gazed out.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a brief survey of the landscape below, he cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Steer to the eastward, Mr. Reade.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank changed the angle of the steering plane, and the
airship turned to port, and sped along on a beam wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Below them laid the coast, and the storm was gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not a sail was in view on the Gulf, but some leagues away
the village of Santa Anna was to be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were some reefs and keys lying off the shore, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>which the sea was breaking, and a few sea gulls skimmed
through the sky beneath the Jove.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every few minutes schools of flying fish rose from the
water, fluttered their gauzy, gleaming wings, shot across a
distance of a few yards, and plunged into the water again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here and there a few sparse palms sent their gaunt forms
towering skyward from the midst of arid open places, dense
jungles and huge swamps.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally Zamora pointed ahead and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is the pirates’ stronghold.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me see,” said Frank, curiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he looked down he observed a large land-locked lagoon
which was fed by a long creek from the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along the creek on both sides were several forts with powerful
guns mounted behind stout walls of masonry.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be impossible for a ship hostile to the pirates
to traverse the creek without being destroyed before it could
reach the lagoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, the creek was so shallow that only vessels of
light draught could pass up or down; hence war ships of
almost any type could not float there.</p>

<p class='c000'>High hills and rocks surrounded the lagoon, so that it
was concealed from the view of any one on land or sea,
and vigilant sentinels were to be seen keeping a close guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>The village of the pirates consisted of a cluster of stone
houses planted around the head waters of the lagoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>In their midst rose a more imposing edifice, which was
evidently used by Diavolo, and dubbed his castle.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were numerous men, women and children thronging
the narrow streets of the village, gazing up at the airship
and betraying the most intense excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as Zamora saw the castle, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s the place where my child is confined.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m going down and try to get him,” Frank replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now?” asked the Mexican, in surprise and delight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, now; tell the boys to arm themselves.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Zamora hastened out and Frank stopped the propellers,
whereupon the Jove began to settle down.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she was going down, Frank caught view of several men
at a swivel gun in one of the forts.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were aiming the piece at the airship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank rapidly made up his mind to drop a hand grenade
down upon the gun to destroy it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before he could carry out this plan, however, there came
a sudden report from the weapon.</p>

<p class='c000'>A shot flew screaming up at the flying machine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw it coming.</p>

<p class='c000'>He made a rapid effort to avoid it.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he failed to do so.</p>

<p class='c000'>Straight at the Jove flew the shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>It struck the planes and passed through them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two large holes were made in them through which the
air rushed rapidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of dismay escaped the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’ve crippled us!” he groaned.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments the Jove landed in the water of the lagoon
with a violent splash, and the pirates gave a yell, and
rushing to their rowboats, embarked, and pulled out to her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>STUCK IN THE MUD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Jove was as buoyant as a cork, and readily floated
upon the water when she recovered from her first plunge in
the brine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had built her for such an emergency as this, and
knew she could not stay under water.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the planes were injured by the shot, and she could not
be driven aloft until they were repaired.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime our friends were exposed to great danger,
for all the pirates who had been in the settlement had
embarked in a fleet of rowboats and were approaching.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are armed to the teeth, and evidently mean to attack
us now,” said Frank, as his companions ran in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bedad, it’s a warm reception they’ll be afther gettin’,”
the Irishman replied, with a grin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a pity the Jove met with this misfortune,” said
Zamora, disappointedly. “I was expecting to rescue my boy
and now we cannot do so, but must spend our time fighting
these villains. It is a shame!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gosh!” said Pomp; “dey am bery nigh us now, Marse
Frank, an’ dis chile s’pecs we done bettah git ready fo’ ’em.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The inventor nodded.</p>

<p class='c000'>He closed the metal shutters over the windows by pulling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>a lever, and geared the steering wheel to the stern rudder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he started the big propellers fanning the air, and
they drove the boat through the water at a moderate rate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s as good as a sthameboat she bes,” said Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. The propellers move her fairly well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By jingo! dey cotch us, dough, wif dem yere rowboats.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I expect they will, Pomp.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then one of the pirates yelled in Spanish:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Surrender!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never!” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you want us to fire at you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s immaterial to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The inventor’s cool indifference angered the man, and
he turned to his companions and gave them an order.</p>

<p class='c000'>A volley of pistol and rifle shots followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>They played a tattoo upon the airship, but she was proof
against such weapons, and the bullets did no harm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fools!” said Frank, contemptuously; “they might just
as well fling pebbles against a brick wall.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“G’way from dar now!” roared Pomp, as he dashed out
on deck, with the Mexican and Irishman. “G’way, I tele
yo’, chilen! D’yo’ want us to plug yo’ full ob lead, huh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>By way of reply came a second volley.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bullets merely flattened against the netting or
glanced off, for they had not force enough to penetrate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Protruding the muzzles of their repeating air rifles
through the loopholes in the cage, the three now opened fire
upon the men in the rowboats.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many a cry of agony told that the persons aimed at had
been hit by the bullets.</p>

<p class='c000'>It surprised the natives to find that they could not reach
our friends, and it alarmed them to discover that they were
getting the worst of the battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly they rapidly retreated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thirty shots had been fired at them, and not a sound save
a puff of wind came from the rifles, but the bullets were
patterned after torpedoes and burst upon contact.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fearful execution followed as the flying fragments of
the exploded bullets scattered and hit the various ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although only thirty shots had been fired, as was said, at
least fifty men were wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dey am gwine,” said Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frightened, I’ll bet,” Barney added.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Chase them, Mr. Reade,” shouted the Mexican.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; let them go,” Frank replied from the dome. “We
must try to get out of the water and repair the planes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; but the moment we get up in the air they will
fire at the Jove and drop her again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not if we keep high out of gun range in future,” Frank
answered, he sent the machine shoreward.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was heading his invention to land at a point distant
from where the gang were.</p>

<p class='c000'>But just as she arrived within fifty feet of the shore, there
came a grating sound under her keel, and then a heavy shock
which ran through her, and almost felled the crew where
they stood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jove paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had run into a mud flat.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been hidden under the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>There she stuck, as if held by a vise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Confound it!” cried Frank, in tones of vexation, when
he saw what happened. “We are in a trap.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Put full power into the propellers,” suggested Zamora.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank tried the plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>It proved useless, however.</p>

<p class='c000'>He finally cut out the electric current.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s of no use!” he exclaimed, in an exasperated tone.</p>

<p class='c000'>A yell of joy escaped their enemies just then, for they
seemed to realize what had happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Howl, ye divils!” roared Barney, shaking his fist at
them angrily, “but, be me sowl! it’s a dose of hot lead I’ll
pump inter yez, if I have me own way about it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whut yer gwine ter do?” shouted Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All I can think of is to wait for the rising tide to lift
us,” replied Frank, after a moment’s thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>This plan did not suit the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>It meant a long delay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before they liberated the Jove there was a strong chance
of the pirate gang getting the best of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still they had to endure what followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within a short time Frank saw a number of the gang
appear upon the roof of the castle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through an opening he observed that they were hauling a
gun into position to train it upon the Jove.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See there, boys. Look up at the castle!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“Holy floy!” roared Barney. “It’s a target they’ll make
av us! D’yez moind ther ould pop-gun av thim?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Two shots from that piece may destroy us,” said the
Mexican, in serious tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dunno!” replied Pomp, seriously. “’Spec not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You forget our Gatling,” interposed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney gave a cheer.</p>

<p class='c000'>He rushed inside the next moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pomp, ye rapscallion! come wid me!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwine to fotch de gun out, honey?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They both vanished.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they were seen again they were hauling out a rapid
fire gun operated by electricity.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was one of Frank’s best inventions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weapon was capable of firing 1,000 shots a minute,
and as the bullets hurled from the piece were steel explosive
shells, it may be inferred what a dangerous piece of mechanism
the gun was when in operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as it was on deck Frank loaded it by adjusting a
coil of cartridges on a reel at the breech fastened to a long
ribbon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arranging the cold water reservoir for keeping it cool,
and attaching two electric wires, the inventor was ready.</p>

<p class='c000'>The turn of a wheel brought the muzzle to the desired
elevation, and in a moment Frank touched a small lever.</p>

<p class='c000'>That put the piece in operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reports that followed were blended so closely together
that they sounded like the ripping of a piece of silk.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the flying shots fairly whistled.</p>

<p class='c000'>As that appalling hail of bullets began to fly up at the
gunners upon the roof, several fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest ran for their lives, and the weapon they had been
preparing was almost destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>One round was enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank smiled, and remarked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are rid of them now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then we are safe?” ventured Zamora.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Temporarily,” answered the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>A quarter of an hour passed slowly by.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the end of that time the distant booming of a gun was
heard coming from the direction of the forts.</p>

<p class='c000'>A shell flew through the air and landed in the lagoon,
not far from where the Jove lay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank gave a start.</p>

<p class='c000'>A troubled look crossed his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s bad!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whar dat shot cum from?” asked Pomp, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One of the forts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith! it’s bombarded we are, thin?” asked Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I fear so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All could share his alarm.</p>

<p class='c000'>They realized their jeopardy only too well.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fast where she floated, the airship was almost at the
mercy of her enemy’s guns, and it made them feel uneasy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To see us is impossible from the forts,” said Frank, “but
a stray shot may fly this way and hit us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’t we reply?” asked Zamora.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No. Our gun is not a mortar, and in this case is almost
useless,” replied the young inventor, sadly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ de lawd! must we stay heah, an’ take all dey sen’?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see no help for it,” Frank answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prospect made all feel decidedly blue, and they soon
heard another report and saw a second shell coming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>ATTACKING THE PIRATES’ LAIR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The morning was far advanced by the time the second
shot came from the fort somewhere along the creek.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ball landed in the water near the stranded Jove,
and Frank anxiously gazed at the shore to see if the tide
was rising.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was impossible to lift the flying machine from the mud
flat till the tide came up.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates in the rowboat had all gone ashore.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One of their shots is bound to hit us if we remain here
long enough,” said Frank. “We must get ashore.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How kin yo’ lif’ de airship off ob de mud?” asked Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll find a means of moving her!”</p>

<p class='c000'>As Frank made this assertion he pondered deeply, and
finally passed into the engine-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dynamo was working at its full capacity, and the big
propellers were whirling furiously.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Yet there was not power enough to drag the Jove off the
mud flat by going ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why not reverse the screws?” thought Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an inspiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>He tried the plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was much easier to back the Jove from the muddy elevation
than to force her over it, he soon found.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within a few moments she was dragged free.</p>

<p class='c000'>A subdued cheer escaped her crew.</p>

<p class='c000'>Back she went into deep water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once afloat Frank changed her course.</p>

<p class='c000'>She reached the hard shore, left the lagoon, and ran upon
the land rapidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Gatling gun was put in operation, and the
crowd fled precipitately.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ignorant of the boat’s landing, the men at the fort kept
bombarding the water with shots.</p>

<p class='c000'>Into the main street of the village ran the Jove, her huge
planes towering high as she rolled along.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Erin go bragh!” roared Barney. “We’re off!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang, bang, bang! went the gun, and a veritable hail of
bullets whistled through the streets and rattled against the
houses as she ran.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They fear us now, and are retreating,” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bueno!” Zamora replied, excitedly. “Head for the castle,
and perhaps, in their excitement, we may save my boy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp ran forward to join Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he passed the compartment in which Captain Diavolo
had been confined, he saw the door standing open.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coon was startled.</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused and peered in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Diavolo was missing.</p>

<p class='c000'>An open window showed how he escaped.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ de lawd amussy!” gasped Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he saw that the pirate had severed his bonds on the
edge of a piece of broken bottle lying on the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had evidently knocked the bottle from a shelf and
smashed it in order to get the piece of glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>“De prisoner hab escaped!” roared the coon, excitedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s bad,” commented Frank, gravely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp explained matters.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he finished the inventor stopped the Jove.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Zamora ran in, the latter shouting:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ain’t you going ahead?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” replied Frank. “At least not until we repair the
planes. We are crippled without their aid.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Amn’t dis rudder a dangerous place fo’ ter done dat,
sah?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, Pomp; for all the pirates are gone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank rushed out on deck as he spoke, and after a keen
survey of the injured parts, he returned within the machine,
procured the necessary tools, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney, come and help me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go ahead wid yer, Misther Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dem yere pirates gwine to swat yer wif a shot a minute
yo’ poke yo’ nose out de doah,” cautioned the coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You and Zamora keep guard,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” replied the Mexican, grasping a rifle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor and his companion thereupon left
the interior and ran up the shrouds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quickly reaching the first plane, they set to work with a
will and began repairing it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A patch was put over the hole and riveted.</p>

<p class='c000'>This done, they ascended to the top plane and began to
work, but in a few moments a volley of distant shots was
heard, and a storm of bullets flew around them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney gave a cry of pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shot?” queried Frank, in alarm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure; I have a bullet in me brain!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And still live?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Och, worra, worra! I’m a dead man!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me see where it hit you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Clap your oye on me neck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, tell me ther truth——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“About what?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will I doi?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Humbug! You only got a scratch.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“May ther Blessed Vargin love ther spalpeen who chucked
that bullet at me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bekase he didn’t kill me intoirely.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank laughed and resumed his work, and Pomp and
the Mexican sent shot after shot toward the sharp-shooters
who had fired at their companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>That ended the shooting.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Frank and Barney finished their task, descended to the
deck, and entered the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now we can storm the castle from the sky,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you can get into that building,” the Mexican remarked,
“you can get the treasure I told you of.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must first drive out the inmates.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A hard job, I fear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the contrary, it will be quite easy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How so, senor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will blow the building to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be careful lest you injure my child.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have no fear on that score, Zamora.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank then entered the pilot-house, and drove the Jove
ahead at the top of her speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had gone up a hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>At one side was a cliff.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank steered her for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Straight to the edge she rushed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It made Zamora shudder as she leaped from the cliff into
the air while going at a high rate of speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out she flew like a gun shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she sank a trifle, but the wind cushioned her great
planes and she floated steadily.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, she had plunged ahead, and the inventor elevated
the forward plane, and she mounted higher.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank steered her in circles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Around and around she went, and she rose to a height
of several hundred feet above the village.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everything below kept diminishing in size.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She flies as well as she did before the accident,” said
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, she does that,” assented Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Looker de fog rollin’ ober de Gulf,” said Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s very dense. But bring out some bombs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The coon and the Celt obeyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weapons alluded to resembled huge steel cartridges
and were loaded with a dynamite-like powder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank began to drop them out the window upon the big
castle below, and every one that struck burst with a loud
report, and blew up a portion of the building.</p>

<p class='c000'>Zamora peered down through a powerful spyglass and
suddenly exclaimed in anxious tones:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The pirates are evacuating the town.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see them going in their rowboats,” Frank replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There go some from the castle.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you distinguish them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Several—yes, and there’s Diavolo.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The captain, eh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He carries some one in his arms, and—ah, by heavens!
it’s my boy! It’s my boy, Mr. Reade.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Down with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’s entering a boat. There he goes out on the water!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go down, I say!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hush! Don’t get excited! Pomp, let her descend!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky nodded his woolly head, and let the airship descend
toward the lagoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the escaping pirates saw the Jove; a babel of excited
voices rose, and they pulled swiftly through the creek to the
sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fog rolled up just then and hid them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally Zamora cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s a ship—the Golden Lion—at the inlet!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She stands luffed up, and all are boarding her, too,” said
Frank, critically. “They design to escape.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a remarkably short space of time all the fugitives had
boarded the vessel, and she sped away.</p>

<p class='c000'>After her flew the Jove.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the fog swallowed the pirate cruiser, and it melted
from view and was not seen again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was bitterly disappointed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll hunt for that ship till I find her!” he exclaimed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='IX' class='c009'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE END OF ONE OF THE SHIPS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“She’s gone!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank’s words wrung a groan of anguish from Zamora,
and the declining sun lent the Mexican’s face a haggard
look.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor little Leon!” he muttered, tremulously. “Shall
we never save you from the clutches of that incarnate
fiend?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney felt sorry for the man.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“Faith, it’s a week now since ther gang escaped us on that
ship,” he muttered, “an’ we’ve hunted the say an’ coasht
well for thim, but there’s no findin’ thim at all, at all, since
ther fog shwallied ’em that day!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwine down to de sea, Marse Frank?” asked Pomp,
who held the steering wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Skim over the sea along the coast,” advised the inventor,
“and we may meet the Golden Lion and save little Leon
yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed to be a forlorn hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp brought the flying machine to within a few hundred
feet of the waves.</p>

<p class='c000'>He then resigned his place to Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’se gwine fo’ to cook suppah,” said he.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lay ther coorse,” said the Irishman to Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go to the eastward.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aist it bes,” assented Barney, revolving the wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The airship was quite close to a range of frowning cliffs
that hemmed the coast and advanced rapidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the far distance was a solitary ship, almost becalmed,
for the weather was very quiet and hot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ahead a cluster of palms on a narrow, flat neck of land,
projected out into the Gulf, assuming the singular look
as if they were growing out of the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jove shot toward them.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she drew nearer a gun shot was heard coming from
behind the palms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank expected to feel the shot, but was disappointed,
and ordered Barney to drive ahead till they investigated the
shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Peaceful people do not fire gunshots for nothing,” said
Frank. “Outlaws carry arms.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“D’ye moind that,” said Barney, pointing out at the ship
they had first seen lying off at sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A puff of smoke is rising from her deck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is that. An’ she’s headin’ this way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They failed to see a shot strike, although the puff of
smoke plainly showed them that the shot had come from
the deck of the distant vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank suddenly changed his tactics.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turning the Jove, he steered her shoreward.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are yer goin’?” queried Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m going to land behind them rocks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Phwat for?” asked the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To watch yonder craft from a place of concealment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ter foind out his game, av coorse.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes: his actions are very mysterious.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A short time afterward the Jove alighted at a place where
she could not be seen from the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and his companions got up on the rocks and
watched the distant vessel very closely.</p>

<p class='c000'>They imagined, of course, that she was one of Captain
Diavolo’s fleet, and resolved to pounce upon her at the
earliest opportunity after learning her intention.</p>

<p class='c000'>The airship was then at least twenty leagues from the retreat
of the pirates, for the long search they had for the
vessel that carried Leon away had taken them far from the
lair of the Coast Terrors.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Zamora, you heard Diavolo say he had two schooners
and a steamer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly so,” returned the dark-faced Mexican.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Does that look like one of their ships?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Decidedly not. It looks more like a frigate.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s a fact. How queer!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know what to make of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When the vessel got nearer they saw that she really was
a man-of-war, but failed to recognize her nationality.</p>

<p class='c000'>She hove in within a mile of the coast, and then suddenly
ran to the west of where our friends laid.</p>

<p class='c000'>This odd action was quickly explained by the sudden appearance
of a schooner that darted around the wooded promontory,
which the frigate was heading off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the schooner’s bow was the name Chimpanzee.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as Zamora saw it he exclaimed, excitedly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, here comes one of Diavolo’s vessels now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” replied Frank. “And see, that frigate is heading
her off, and evidently means to capture her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bedad! we’ll see some fun now!” chuckled Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My Lawd!” roared Pomp. “See dar!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The frigate had run toward what looked like a buoy, when
she struck a mine and exploded it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A deafening report ensued.</p>

<p class='c000'>The water at the warship’s stern was blown up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shocked, torn and wrecked, the gallant vessel rolled,
pitched and tossed furiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>The torpedo had done its fatal work well.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>She began to go down by the stern.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By heavens!” ejaculated Frank, in tones of intense
horror, “those scoundrels purposely lured the frigate upon
that marine mine to destroy her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“An’ dey done doed it,” groaned Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The craft is a wreck!” exclaimed Zamora.</p>

<p class='c000'>The piratical vessel paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>A hoarse cheer rose from her crew.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a scene of great confusion ensued upon the deck of
the warship, for all hands had been mustered to prepare the
boats for debarkation.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evidently the pirate’s intention to cut off their
retreat to the land by intercepting and killing them mercilessly.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this purpose in view they were arming themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Unless we interfere,” said Frank, restlessly, “there is
soon going to be some bloody work done here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ suah,” assented Pomp. “Dem yer yaller coons use
dar razzahs on de marines, I ’specs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’t we interfere?” eagerly asked Zamora.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, we will that!” Barney asserted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor saw the frigate go down, and all her
ill-fated crew were left afloat in the quarter-boats.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are absolutely at the mercy of the demons of the
Gulf,” Frank muttered. “Come on, boys!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They quickly boarded the electric airship, and the young
inventor, anxious to lend a hand to his endangered fellow-beings,
turned on the current.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the screws turned the airship rolled ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Impinging on the wind, her planes lifted her from the
ground, and she mounted higher as she rushed along.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within a few moments Frank saw the schooner bearing
down upon the six boats, a large crew armed to the teeth
swarming over her deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rascals did not hesitate about firing, and as a deadly
fusillade was poured out at the marines many of the unfortunates
fell killed or wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Zamora, take the wheel,” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, senor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hold the Jove over them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Get some grenades, boys.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp and Barney procured the weapons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Armed with these deadly missiles the three passed out on
deck, and began to hurl them down upon the deck of the
piratical schooner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flying metal mowed down the rascals, and they quickly
had their attention turned away from their victims.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sight of the flying machine filled them with horror,
and most of them made a rush for the forecastle, the cabin,
and the open hatches to get below.</p>

<p class='c000'>But our friends continued to hurl down the bombs, and
soon the missiles set fire to the schooner.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the blaze increased the yells of the pirates became horrible
to hear, and they rushed on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wildly they rushed for their boats.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of them did not wait for the boats.</p>

<p class='c000'>They simply sprang into the water and swam away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rascals hoped to have some time, but the fire reached
their magazine by the time two of the boats were put overboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fearful explosion followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>High in the air the torn ship was blown, the bodies of
over half her crew mingled with the broken planks and torn
cordage.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the time the scattered remains of the schooner came
down, the naval soldiers were rowing after the two boats
that escaped.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crews of these two boats were rowing like mad for the
shore, for they expected no mercy from the crew of the
sunken gunboat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the rascals could reach the coast, the marines hove
up and surrounded them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates were surrounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>A deadly volley of shots poured in upon the screaming
wretches from all sides, and when the marines finished their
shooting, not a pirate lived to tell what had happened.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='X' class='c009'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>THE PIRATES’ TREASURE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Frank and his companions witnessed the extermination of
the gang of pirates, and when it was completed, Barney
said:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Begorra, there’s not wan left.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So much the better,” Frank answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lord amassy! but it war drefful, Marse Frank,” said
Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“True; but had they been captured and court-martialed,
they would have been shot, anyway,” replied the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sure enough,” assented Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Zamora!” called the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?” the Mexican answered from his post at the
wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Run her away to the eastward.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ain’t you going down to interview the marines?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No. What’s the use? It would do no good. We have
seen what happened. The scene explains itself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, thim sogers moight be loikin’ to know who we
are,” said Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will mystify them by giving no information.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That settled the matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>On went the flying machine, and they heard the marines
shout up to them, and saw them beckoning, but they paid no
heed to the calls.</p>

<p class='c000'>The airship soon faded from the view of those below, and
went scouring along the coast for the next few days in quest
of the Golden Lion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unfortunately, though, they did not see her.</p>

<p class='c000'>A number of ships were encountered, but the vessels they
sought were not among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>One morning, at breakfast, Frank said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is my opinion that Captain Diavolo has taken fright,
and intends to hide until we’re gone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Deed it looks dat way,” Pomp asserted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What shall we do then?” queried Zamora, in troubled
tones, for his mind was constantly harassed by the fear that
some harm had befallen his little boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m going back to the town,” said Frank, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, we’ll foind no wan there,” Barney replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t expect to, but we may secure their treasure if
Zamora will show us its hiding place.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dis am de bestest time fo’ to go dar, while de pirates
am away,” assented Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this agreement the airship was started off, and late
in the afternoon arrived in view of the settlement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The place had a deserted look.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not one of the gang left,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then we will not be molested in our efforts to get the
treasure,” said Zamora.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You said it was in the vault under the castle?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s where I saw it, senor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know how to reach it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, we will remove it from its present place, and by
the time this is done the pirates, missing us, may think we
have gone away, and make their reappearance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quite a good idea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can pounce on them, and make a struggle to get your
son from their clutches.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This plan pleased Zamora.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few minutes afterward the Jove settled down in the big
square facing the castle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving Barney in charge of her, the others armed themselves,
took a portable electric lantern, and strode over to
Captain Diavolo’s dwelling.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shots they had rained down upon it had almost blown
the upper part to pieces, and it presented a battered look
that spoiled its beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a fine entrance, and the trio passed into a
large corridor, upon which several rooms opened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Proceeding to the rear, a broad staircase was reached,
which led them into the cellar beneath the building.</p>

<p class='c000'>By turning a switch on the lantern a bright light was
caused to gush from the bull’s-eye.</p>

<p class='c000'>Zamora led the way, as he was familiar with the place,
and going to one of the stone foundation walls, he pointed
at an iron door studded with huge bolt heads.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is the treasure vault,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is fastened with a huge padlock,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bust her open,” suggested Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was easy to do this, as Frank had provided himself with
several of the hand grenades.</p>

<p class='c000'>All hands recoiled from the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inventor then hurled a bomb at the padlock; there
sounded a furious explosion, a glare of light was seen, and
then the lock was blown to pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>As this occurred the three rushed to the door, flung it
open, the lantern light was projected inside, and a most
thrilling scene met their view.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The floor of the storeroom was littered with boxes, bales,
casks and packages stolen from ship and shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>They contained rich laces, silks and velvets, expensive ornaments,
paintings, statuary, silverware, and other articles
made of gold and other precious metals.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several kegs were filled to overflowing with gold coins of
foreign countries; there was a box containing a large assortment
of bejeweled rings, pins and other jewelry, and
a small casket of unset diamonds, pearls and rubies stood
upon a tiny table in one corner.</p>

<p class='c000'>A number of vases, chalices, crucifixes and similar secular
objects laid on the floor, showing plainly that the Terror
of the Coast did not scruple about robbing churches.</p>

<p class='c000'>No matter in what direction the glance turned, a new
object of great interest was seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The three gazed around spellbound.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Frank finally recovered from his surprise, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Zamora, I am amazed at the richness of this treasure.
You did not exaggerate it any. In fact, you did not do it
justice. There are several million dollars’ worth of stuff
here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’se gwine ter open a bank when I gits my share ob dis,”
chuckled Pomp. “Wonder whar it all come from, chillen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The pirates waded knee deep in blood to gain this treasure,”
replied Zamora, in grave tones. “It represents many
a hard-fought battle, many a human life, many widows
and orphans.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us get away from here,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He selected the most valuable things and each one seized a
parcel, and carried it from the vault.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they reached the main cellar a terrible surprise awaited
them, in the form of a horde of the pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were headed by Captain Diavolo.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one of the rascals carried a weapon, and the Terror
pointed at the startled trio, and yelled:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Halt!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Trapped!” gasped Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By golly!” said the coon; “dis am an ambush!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s the end of us!” said Zamora, bitterly.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was very evident that the rascals had been hidden in
the castle, had seen them coming, and now expected to kill
or capture them, for every weapon was pointed their way.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a full minute a deathly silence ensued.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the pirate captain roared:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Drop those valuables!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Obediently the three let their burdens fall to the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Raise your hands!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The three complied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turning to his men, Diavolo said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aim at them, boys!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Going to shoot them now?” queried one of the gang.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; there’s no use delaying.”</p>

<p class='c000'>These words sent a chill of horror through our friends,
for they did not expect their doom was to be settled so soon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was utterly at a loss what to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>Resistance would simply hasten their deaths.</p>

<p class='c000'>He resolved, though, to gain a short respite by parleying,
for he hoped, in a feverish way, that in the interval he might
think of some method whereby he could save the party.</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore he said to the captain:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You surely do not mean to kill us in cold blood?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t I, though?” sneered the wretch.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give us time to prepare for our doom.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not a minute, curse you! I’ve got the whip hand now,
and I’ll make you pay dearly for the losses and trouble and
indignity you have put me to. And as for you,” he added,
furiously, shaking his fist at Zamora, “I could tear your
heart from your living body, blast you! I haven’t forgotten
the choking you gave me, you dog!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Kill me and spare the others,” pleaded the Mexican. “I
am not afraid to die, since it seems impossible for me to
wrest my unfortunate child from your vile clutch.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll kill you all!” shouted the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Could we bribe you to let us go?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not with a king’s ransom! Revenge to me is far sweeter
than gold. I’ll have no mercy! Aim, boys, and when I
count three, fire at them together!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He stepped aside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank gave up all hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Death now seemed a moral certainty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The grim array of weapons was turned upon them and the
brutal captain cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“One!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then there was a pause.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Two!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>“Git away out av that!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Boom, bang!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go it, ye divils! Go it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Crash, boom!</p>

<p class='c000'>First it was Barney’s voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then it was the roar of the grenades.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next it was a chorus of oaths, yells, and cries of pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last it was a general stampede of the pirates before
they had time to fire the fatal volley with which they designed
to kill Frank and his two companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah! A rescue!” cried the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fire at them!” gasped Zamora, using his pistol.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp bent over, charged on a man who was in his way,
butted him like a goat, and knocked the fellow over.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Clar de track!” he bawled. “De coon bullgine am
comin’!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang!</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang!</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang! went their pistol shots!</p>

<p class='c000'>It was lucky Barney had taken it into his head to arm
himself with grenades and follow his friends, for he had seen
what happened, and made a bold charge to save them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates fled in all directions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many were wounded by the bursting grenades.</p>

<p class='c000'>The electric lantern showed the Irishman where his
friends were, so that he was enabled to use his arms in such
a way as not to hurt them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of Diavolo’s men fired back, but were so panic-stricken
their aim was bad, and they did no damage.</p>

<p class='c000'>A grand rush was made for a secret exit which they had
entered, but many had fallen never to rise again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Chase them!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oireland foriver!” howled Barney, for the fighting
Irishman was in his glory when a row was going on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Away they rushed in pursuit of the fleeing pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only half a dozen reached the courtyard, and the diabolical
captain was in the lead.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that his life would pay for his capture.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang!</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang!</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang! went a second volley from Frank’s party.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several of Diavolo’s party fell in their tracks, wounded,
and our friends chased the rest through the corridor.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Frank dashed out the door he saw the leader and several
of his men rushing toward the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were heading for a rowboat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Far over the water, lying almost hidden against the dense
shrubbery and trees along the shore was a schooner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates were evidently bent upon reaching it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s Diavolo’s other craft!” cried Zamora.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your son is doubtless aboard of her, too,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dios mio! Can we save him now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps; if we can prevent Diavolo getting aboard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can’t overtake him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes; we can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By using the airship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bueno!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They ran to the Jove and scrambled aboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within one minute more Frank had her rushing swiftly
across the square, and she rose on the wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up she soared like an eagle.</p>

<p class='c000'>A turn of the wheel directed her over the water, and she
shot along at a rapid pace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Below, Frank saw Diavolo in a skiff with three men, and
they were rowing furiously toward the schooner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney, take the wheel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now watch that skiff vanish.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And so saying Frank rushed inside and got several
bombs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Going out on deck, he leaned over the side, and taking
careful aim, he let one of the grenades fall.</p>

<p class='c000'>It went down as straight as an arrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>All hands watched it with deep interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang!</p>

<p class='c000'>It had struck squarely in the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>In one minute more the tiny craft was gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only one of the occupants survived, and that was Diavolo.</p>

<p class='c000'>They saw the burly rascal swimming feebly for the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>He finally reached it, waded out, rushed away, and darting
a scared look up at the Jove, he plunged into the bushes.</p>

<p class='c000'>There he vanished.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a pity he escaped!” said Zamora, disappointedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He wor wounded,” said Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It won’t be long before we meet him again, I feel quite
confident,” remarked Frank, in dry tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwine fo’ de schoonah?” queried the coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes, by all means—at once,” Frank replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See!” muttered the Mexican, nervously, as he pointed
at the vessel. “The crew seem to realize what has happened,
and are preparing to sail away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Drive the Jove over there, Barney,” cried Frank,
quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The airship was about five hundred feet above the sea,
and she glided straight toward the schooner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy, there!” cried Frank, at the top of his voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>No reply came back.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, the chances were his voice was not heard.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he saw the crew of the vessel elevating the muzzle of
a gun to bear upon the airship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing that he had better make his intentions known by
actions rather than words, the young inventor hurled a
bomb down at the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>It struck there and burst with a violent report.</p>

<p class='c000'>That scattered the men from about the gun, and stopped
the work of raising the anchor and sails.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another bomb wounded several more, and drove the crew
overboard, whereupon they took to the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now send her down, Barney.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you distinguish my child?” eagerly asked Zamora.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” Frank replied. “I’ve watched keenly, and did
not see a child leave the schooner. In their panic those fellows
only thought of saving themselves. Doubtless they
have left the boy behind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is very dangerous, then, to use more bombs, as you
might hit him,” said the Mexican.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very true! I’ll stop. Those fellows are greatly afraid
of this airship. They may not be afraid to fight people on
an equal footing, but when it comes to an attack from the
sky they realize their helplessness and lose courage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had told the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly the airship arrived close to the schooner, and
there she was driven in circles in order to keep her in the
air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank could now see what a lot of damage the bombs had
done to the vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went inside and put on a suit of chain mail.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was very light, as the metal was aluminum.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m going aboard the schooner,” he announced.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me go with you,” pleaded Zamora.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; it’s too dangerous. I’ll go alone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Den we guard you from heah wif our rifles,” said Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do so, by all means.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank got out a wire ladder and carried it to the deck,
where he fastened one end and let the other end down.</p>

<p class='c000'>He then descended.</p>

<p class='c000'>When half-way down the ladder he heard volley after volley
of rifle shots coming from shore, and saw the crew
shooting at him from behind trees and rocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scores of bullets hit the daring fellow, and hundreds
whistled and hummed around him like a swarm of bees.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fire at them, boys!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>His friends promptly carried out his order, and an occasional
yell of pain coming from the bushes told that their
shots were not all wasted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, the firing at Frank diminished.</p>

<p class='c000'>He lost no time about getting down the rest of the ladder,
and as the airship circled over the schooner he alighted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the pirates rushed from their coverts, and were
about to dash over, board the vessel, and try to capture him,
when a deadly volley from the Jove checked their impulse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank hastened down the cabin steps.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found the room filled with smoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’ve fired the vessel!” flashed across his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>He groped his way around and shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“Leon! Leon!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But he received no reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The little fellow isn’t here,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c000'>These words had scarcely left his lips, though, when he
stumbled over a soft object lying on the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>One glance showed him that it was the missing boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was senseless.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cruel blow on the head, dealt by one of the pirates, had
knocked him down, wounded and unconscious.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank picked him up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now to escape!” he muttered. “If the fire reaches the
magazine, the schooner will blow up and kill us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He reached the door with his little burden, but to his dismay
found it closed with a spring lock.</p>

<p class='c000'>The knob was broken off, and he therefore could not open
it; nor were the windows big enough to let him out.</p>

<p class='c000'>It made a chill of horror go over Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By heavens! I’m in for it now!” he gasped.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Frank was in a most desperate situation, and he laid the
boy down and searched the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>He finally found an ax, and with this implement he attacked
the door in an effort to burst it down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Blow after blow he dealt it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally the stubborn door yielded.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it went down with a crash he seized Leon Zamora and
hastened upon deck with the senseless boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank’s friends were still firing at the pirates in the
bushes, and a cry of joy escaped them when they saw him
appear with Leon in his arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My son! My son!” frantically cried the Mexican.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over the schooner swept the Jove, and Frank got on the
ladder, whereupon Barney swiftly drove the machine away
over the water toward the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although many bullets were shot at the inventor, they
missed him, and he was carried out of danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>He reached the deck with his burden.</p>

<p class='c000'>The joy of Zamora knew no bounds, and when the boy’s
wound was dressed and he recovered, he was more than
delighted to find himself safe again with his father.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Diavolo’s men were furious when they saw the
inventor safely escape with the little prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Realizing that Frank was liable to attack them, they
made haste to get away from that dangerous locality, and
when the young inventor sent the flying machine on a hunt
for them, not one of the villains was to be found.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They have got enough,” laughed Frank, “and have like
the Arabs silently folded their tents and stolen away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, we kin get their treasure now,” said Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, indeed,” assented Zamora. “The gold is due to
you for having saved my little boy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’se gwine to steer fo’ de ole castle, den,” remarked
Pomp, as he spun the wheel around.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The airship is capable of carrying a weight of several
tons beside what we have already aboard,” said Frank, “and
for that reason we can easily get away with the bulk of the
Terror’s horde.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When they were ready to descend they saw the schooner
blow up, and her remains sunk under the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>It occupied a full day to get the treasure aboard and stow
it. But they finally secured it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not one of the pirates disturbed them, and on the following
morning Frank drove the Jove high in the air, and sent
her along the coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, she mounted so high that she rose above the
clouds in the rare upper atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had control of the wheel when Zamora came in
with his boy and asked him:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you going home now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not yet,” Frank responded, shaking his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is there to keep you in this neighborhood?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Since I started in fighting the Terror of the Coast,” answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the inventor, “I have concluded to not leave my
task unfinished. Captain Diavolo is still at large. He yet
has his steamship to scour this gulf. I am determined to
find the man and his craft, and put them where they will
do no further harm.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a noble resolve, and has my heartfelt sympathy,”
said Don Zamora, earnestly. “And by your leave, senor,
I shall remain aboard until your purpose is finally accomplished,
compadre!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was satisfied.</p>

<p class='c000'>He spent several days after that searching for the villain,
but failed to find him.</p>

<p class='c000'>League after league of the coast was patrolled, and they
finally reached the neighborhood of Florida.</p>

<p class='c000'>Off one of the keys a ship was discerned one morning by
the young inventor, who stood on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>He eagerly scrutinized it with a glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a small steamship flying the American flag.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Zamora,” he called, quickly, “come out here!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, senor; what do you wish?” asked the Mexican,
emerging.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you see that steamer?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Plainly, when there is a rift in the clouds.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Would you take her to be Captain Diavolo’s vessel?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By no means. The Snake is a larger boat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pshaw! I thought it was her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; you are mistaken, I am sorry to say.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank looked intensely disappointed, and cast another
glance down at the vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he did so he saw a very much larger steamer run from
behind the key and race after the first one.</p>

<p class='c000'>The large vessel carried a black flag at the masthead, in
the center of which were a skull and crossbones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s the pirates’ emblem!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ha! That’s her now!” exclaimed the Mexican, excitedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So I perceive,” responded the inventor, leveling his
glass again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Those monsters are intent on running the smaller craft
down and attacking it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course!” cried Frank. “And, by jingo! among the
big gang swarming over the deck of the Snake I recognize
the figure of Captain Diavolo.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then the scoundrel and the crew of the schooner which
contained my boy must have been picked up by this craft,
and carried away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just exactly my impression,” Frank replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp were apprised of the news, and they
eagerly scanned the pirates’ craft.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I reckon dey doan’ ’spec dat we’se ober dar haids up yere
in de clouds,” chuckled the coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, they’ll be afther knowin’ it soon enough,”
laughed Barney, as he spit on his hands and rubbed them together.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he spoke, they heard the faint report of a gun, and saw
a shot strike the stern of the fugitive steamer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Judging by the actions of the vessel, the ball had evidently
struck the rudder or screw, for she ran wild, and her
engineer was obliged to stop her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Terror dashed ahead, and another shot was discharged
from her deck, the ball sweeping the deck of the
other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank grew restless.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must stop them at once!” he exclaimed, “or they
will, perhaps, murder the whole crew. Barney, take charge
and drop the Jove down toward them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave his place to the Irishman, and going back to the
room where the arms were kept, he quickly secured an enormous
grenade, and carried it out on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If this shell lands on her deck it will blow her to pieces,”
he muttered, grimly. “Now for a trial.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Waiting until the airship was almost directly above the
other vessel, Frank let the shell fly.</p>

<p class='c000'>It plunged down through the air quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down, down, down it went at a terrific speed until it had
almost reached the steamer.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>But the Snake dashed ahead, the grenade missed, and it
plunged harmlessly into the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of intense vexation escaped Frank, and he saw his
enemies go flying ahead blissfully ignorant of the great danger
they had escaped.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jove was descending rapidly under Barney’s skillful
guidance, and it soon hovered within a few hundred feet
of the sea when the pirates saw it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fierce yell escaped them, and they swung a big swivel
gun around and fired up at her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shot crashed through the airship’s hull, and the villains
rapidly loaded the gun again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately, our friends were not injured by the shock.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Arm yourselves, boys, arm yourselves,” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a minute more all hands had their weapons ready for
action, and began to fire down at the pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fugitive steamer was near by, and her crew, armed
with several rifles and pistols, were firing at the pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Report after report rang out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clouds of smoke and fumes of powder rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a quarter of an hour the battle waxed hot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates were between two fires, and while half of
them turned their attention upon the steamer’s crew, the
other half engaged at firing at the airship’s crew.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the midst of the conflict one of Diavolo’s gunners discharged
the swivel piece up at the Jove again.</p>

<p class='c000'>This shot smashed into the plane uprights on the port
side, breaking them in two and tearing the braces.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the upper gear began to collapse.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lookout! We’re falling!” shouted Frank. “We can’t
float with that hole in our boat’s hull.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He seized a line as he spoke and flung an end to the crew
of the disabled steamer, while he tied the other end to the
Jove.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same moment Zamora let another of the big bombs
fly out a window at the Snake.</p>

<p class='c000'>The grenade struck the side of the pirates’ vessel, and
tearing a big hole there, caused her to fill.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments it was clear the vessel would be sunk
many fathoms under the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cheer escaped Frank’s party despite their own peril,
when they saw what the Mexican did.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At last I am revenged!” hoarsely cried Zamora, as he
seized his child and ran on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The doom of the flying machine was sealed, for she fluttered
to the water and began to sink.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Haul in on that line and make it fast, boys!” cried
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Working furiously, they dragged the airship to the side
of the disabled steamer and secured her so she could not go
down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Willing hands assisted them aboard the steamer just as
the Snake sank, carrying many of her crew down with her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Diavolo was killed during the explosion of the
grenade, and the crew of the Yankee vessel shot the rest,
who were swimming.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing that his invention could not be repaired where it
was, Frank abandoned all hope of saving her.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few hasty words passed between him and the captain of
the steamer, and the inventor was assured of a passage to
New York in his vessel when she was repaired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he and his friends dragged the treasure out of her
and stowed it below, after which the line holding the Jove
was cut, and our gallant flying machine sank in the deep
Gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our friends told the Yankee crew all about themselves,
and in return learned that the craft had recently left a Mexican
port, and was homeward bound when attacked.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was badly damaged by the shot, but they finally repaired
her so she was able to finish her journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>Zamora and his son were landed in Florida, from whence
they could easily get home, and he warmly thanked Frank
and his friends for all they had done for him and his child.</p>

<p class='c000'>He refused to share the treasure, as he was already
wealthy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our friends, therefore, gave the captain and crew of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>steamer an ample share of it, and divided the rest among
themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>In due time the treasure was all sold, and realized a huge
sum.</p>

<p class='c000'>Landing in New York, our friends proceeded to Readestown,
and received a warm welcome home.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were glad to get home again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank since then has built other wonderful inventions,
and we will soon give our readers an account of another one.
But our story of his greatest flying machine is ended, and
we will, therefore, defer our narrative to the volume which
follows this one.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
